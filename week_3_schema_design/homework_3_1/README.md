# week 3 - homework 3_1

Write a program in the language of your choice that will remove the lowest homework score for each student. Since there is a single document for each student containing an array of scores, you will need to update the scores array and remove the homework.

Remember, just remove a homework score. Don't remove a quiz or an exam!
